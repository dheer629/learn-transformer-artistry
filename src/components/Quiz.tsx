      "To reduce computational complexity",

      "To compress the input sequence",
      "To generate random weights",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Self-attention helps Transformers understand how different words or elements in a sequence relate to each other, similar to how we understand the relationship between words in a sentence.",

    id: 2,
    text: "Which analogy best describes the encoder-decoder structure?",
    options: [
      "A calculator performing math operations",
      "A translator reading one language and writing in another",
      "A computer storing files",
      "A phone making calls",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The encoder-decoder structure is like a translator who first understands the meaning (encoder) and then expresses it in another form (decoder).",

    id: 3,
    text: "How do Transformers process input data?",
    options: [
      "One word at a time, sequentially",
      "All words simultaneously, in parallel",
      "Only the first and last words",
      "Random words only",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Transformers process all input elements (like words) simultaneously, which makes them very efficient compared to sequential processing.",
